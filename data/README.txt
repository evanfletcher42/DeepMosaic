This project uses the Flickr500 dataset, which can be found here: 
https://www.cmlab.csie.ntu.edu.tw/project/Deep-Demosaic/static/dataset.zip

The script "download_dataset.py" in the root directory of this project automates downloading this dataset and separating
it into training (490 images) and validation (10 images) sets.
